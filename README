# Titanic Survival Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover meaningful survival patterns among passengers.  
The goal is to demonstrate **data cleaning, analysis, and insight generation** using Python libraries.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib

## 🔍 What I Did in This Project
- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure and data types  
- Handled missing values using appropriate strategies (median for numerical data, mode for categorical data)  
- Performed **feature engineering** by creating age groups using binning  
- Analyzed survival trends using `groupby()` and aggregation techniques  
- Visualized key insights using simple and clear bar charts

## 📊 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males  
- First-class passengers had better survival chances than third-class passengers  
- Children showed higher survival probability compared to adults and seniors

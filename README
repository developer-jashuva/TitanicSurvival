## 🔍 What I Did in This Project
- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure and data types  
- Handled missing values using appropriate strategies (median for numerical data and mode for categorical data)  
- Performed **feature engineering** by creating age groups using binning techniques  
- Analyzed survival trends using `groupby()` and aggregation functions  
- Visualized key insights using clear and simple bar charts

## 📊 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males  
- First-class passengers had better survival chances than third-class passengers  
- Children showed higher survival probability compared to adults and seniors
